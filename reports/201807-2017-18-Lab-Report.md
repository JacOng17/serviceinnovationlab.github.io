# Exec Summary

This is the final report for the 2017-18 financial year. All deliverables were completed as per the summary in this report. The team also explored the unique value proposition of the Service Innovation Lab which will help inform the cross agency governance bodies on what is best done through the Lab. We also explored emerging technologies and trends and their implications for government, we worked to always collaborate and enable greater innovation throughout the public service in the course of our work, and we explored system barriers and opportunities for genuine digital transformation of the NZ public sector. The Service Innovation Lab, working with agencies and partners across New Zealand, has certainly punched above its weight, and provides a good example of how genuine collaboration around shared goals can drive better outcomes for everyone. 

In June 2018, the Service Innovation Working Group (SIWG, the SI Lab funding and oversight governance body) approved to continue funding the Service Innovation Work Programme (including work done in and with the Lab) for $5.79m, which was an increase on the previous year. It is envisaged $2m of this funding is for SmartStart and End of Life work, and the remaining $3.79m is for work in the SI Lab for work program initiatives agreed by the Service Innovation Reference Group (SIRG). This vote of confidence, especially in the absence of a mandate or requirement for agencies to fund the work program, speaks volumes about the confidence generated in the Service Innovation Lab and work program as a means for agencies to accelerate the design and delivery of better services for the people of New Zealand Aotearoa.

The Service Innovation Lab is a credit to the Service Innovation Reference and Working Groups (our cross agency governance groups), the agency teams & partners who came together with the Lab around life events & proactive entitlements, and the dedicated Service Innovation team who have worked to deliver and support both an environment conducive to genuine collaboration, and a highly skilled workforce to support service innovation.

    <td class="tg-baqh">Services Register 1.0 (Family Services Directory based reusable component, initially for SmartStart use)</td>
    <td class="tg-baqh">Status: Complete. It was clear from early work in the Lab that a services register was a necessary reusable component for integrating information about services across different agencies for users. The first iteration for this reusable component was based on the user needs of SmartStart users to identify relevant family services near them. We worked with MSD to make the Family Services Directory fit for purpose for service delivery and available as an openly available API, courtesy of data.govt.nz.

    <td class="tg-baqh">Entering Tertiary Discovery (TEC)</td>
    <td class="tg-baqh">Status: Complete. This was such a broad potential scope that the Discovery turned into a Pre-Discovery to identify specific opportunities for service improvements and delivery for the myriad user needs identified in the process. It was a collaborative process involving the tertiary sector through TEC engagement, and helps inform the TEC work program.
