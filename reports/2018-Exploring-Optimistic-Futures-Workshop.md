The following is content generated in the Transitioning to an Optimistic Future event held as part of Tech Week 2018. Duration 3 hours.

# Overview

The event was designed to build on the concepts and discussions had as part of the Digital Seven Nations and Optimistic Futures Event. In particular we wanted to focus on the human aspect of transition and what would be required of New Zealanders in the future. The topics of discussion were chosen as they we all universally understood human features and common daily activities. This created a level foundation to debate from as opposed to getting caught up in complex technologies and paradigms that could distract and exclude. The role of technology was tightly framed as an enabler and second to behaviour, attributes and activity.  

Event Description:

Building on the [Optimistic Futures](https://www.optimisticfutures.nz/) event held earlier in the year, in this workshop we will explore what's required for New Zealand/Aotearoa to transition to a better future, moving from an 18th century to a 21st century society.

This includes considering:

* the role of government
* the role of technology
* what foundations are needed to support society
* what role everyone would play in an optimistic future
