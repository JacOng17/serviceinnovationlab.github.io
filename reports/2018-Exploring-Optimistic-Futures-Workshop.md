<span class="subtitle">Led by Matthew MacCallum and Ben Briggs, Service Innovation Lab</span>

The following is content generated in the Transitioning to an Optimistic Future event held as part of Tech Week 2018. Duration 3 hours.

# Overview

The event was designed to build on the concepts and discussions had as part of the Digital Seven Nations and Optimistic Futures Event. In particular we wanted to focus on the human aspect of transition and what would be required of New Zealanders in the future. The topics of discussion were chosen as they we all universally understood human features and common daily activities. This created a level foundation to debate from as opposed to getting caught up in complex technologies and paradigms that could distract and exclude. The role of technology was tightly framed as an enabler and second to behaviour, attributes and activity.  

Event Description:

Building on the [Optimistic Futures](https://www.optimisticfutures.nz/) event held earlier in the year, in this workshop we will explore what's required for New Zealand/Aotearoa to transition to a better future, moving from an 18th century to a 21st century society.

This includes considering:

* the role of government
* the role of technology
* what foundations are needed to support society
* what role everyone would play in an optimistic future

Brought to you by [Victoria University of Wellington](https://www.victoria.ac.nz/), [InternetNZ](https://internetnz.nz/) and the [Service Innovation Lab](http://serviceinnovationtoolkit.wikidot.com/main:about).

This event is part of the Techweek series on Building Government’s Digital Service Innovation Capability. The room was divided into 4 large groups for discussion and exploration.

# Activity One - Qualities to thrive as kiwis in 2070

Full Definitions of prioritised qualities: 

Group 1 

1. Empathy/sympathy/self awareness - understanding yourself, others and the impacts/consequences of your actions

* Important because:
** We are seeing the dehumanisation of people in our current systems. Our optimistic future is truly human centred
** Mātauranga Māori instead of economic outcomes, we measure social and environmental ones
** We want a trust based society, not blockchain one
** Rehumanise the workforce

2. Creativity - expression, problem solving, making an intuitive leap, to make an idea tangible. 

* Important because:
** It will enable us to have a viable empowered future
** Without creativity there is no progress
** Forward momentum and flow
** We can’t understand or express the art of the possible 
** Learned helplessness and inability to envisage better systems 
** Creativity makes people unique 

3. Curiosity and love of learning - desire to explore, understand the world around you

* Important because:
** In a changing world, a love of learning will enable us to advance and embrace change with joy. 
** Change as an opportunity not a threat
** The world will only become more complex 
** Love of Learning as a platform for your ability and confidence to respond to complexity 

4. Critical thinking - ability to discern truth, deconstruct content to value, truth and facts, ability to contextualise information - natural motivations, values etc

* Important because:
** Deception will become grander and more complex (especially technological ability to fabricate falsehood)
** Value truth over a good story

5. Maker Skills - the skills and perspective that assumes you can form the world around you, you are not bound by the tools you have, you build what you need and are empowered to do so

* Important because:
** We have the tech to create anything - enables us to build bespoke solutions for what we need
** Don’t have to be passive consumers
** Empowered to be critical creative and make things

Group 2 Defs:

1. Trust - don't fear interactions, know/respect boundaries and rules, vulnerability, it’s reflective/2-way, honesty, accountability - implied or explicit, foundation of the relationship, being treated as a human being
2. Diversity - wanting to scan all options and ways of doing things, sense of self is valued, open ears, allowance for differences, ability to express views, how to channel power through process, inclusion, learning from others, rights, “recognising the power of paradigm”, respect for people, ability to participate, social norms
3. Empathy - do things with people not to people, understanding without appropriation, try to feel what other people feel, empathetic > Sympathetic (empowering > Patronising)
4. Curiosity - opportunity to learn, improve, contribute, at the top of the hierarchy of needs, in the boundaries of what’s acceptable, ethics, different power structures, may be self-disruptive, it’s good but can be dangerous.
5. Reflection - share failures, transparency, look in the mirror, meditative, requires space and time, truth - don’t erase the facts, fits with work/life balance, understanding our past and learning from it, take pause and reflect integrate inputs

Group 3 Defs;

1. Courageous - Be brave about change, be willing to be the first to act.
2. Resilient - Internal strength and ability to push through adversity with optimism and adaptability
3. Kind & Inclusive - With compassion and responsibility actively enable and support participation in society and valuing differences
4. Sustainable - Consider long term impact and understand we’re living from finite resources 
5. Decisive - To make decisions and act with confidence, with timeliness and being aware of trade offs. Clarity of thought, long term thinking. Being more comfortable with failure. 

Group 4 Defs:

1. Resourceful - Curiosity, innovative adaptive and critically engaged
2. Ethical - Empathetic, considerate, equitable
3. Risk Tolerant - Confident, positive and patient in response to changing environment
4. Diverse - Open, tolerant, values driven, respectful of difference
5. Environmentally Responsive - Improvement driven, technologically fluent, climate disruption, responsive

* Important because: 
** Innovate or Die
** Subjugation aint cool
** Without progress and the confidence to take risks only stagnation results
** Acceptance of diversity underpins respect
** Survival!
** Empathy - How does it work through technology? It’s a very human characteristic 

# Activity Two - Performing actions today vs 2070

Participants were asked to choose one of the following activities and explore the process both today and in 2070 and how their qualities from Activity One might impact how they are performed. 

Activities:

* Start a business
* Get a health check

Below are the present and future states each group brainstormed. We intentionally looks 50 years out to think about new horizons rather than iterations on the status quo.

## Grow food - nutrition

Now:

* Plan (space, season, crops, compliance)
* Prepare (dig, single vs family vs commercial consumption, water requirements, pest control, fencing, composting/supplements)
* Plants, maintain, harvest and back to planning with some automation employed for larger operations.

2070:

* Vertical, shared and more diversity in crops and methods
* Disruption to supply chain
* Tracability of crop lineage and social responsibility
* Better ways to measure the value of growing food
* Reflection an
