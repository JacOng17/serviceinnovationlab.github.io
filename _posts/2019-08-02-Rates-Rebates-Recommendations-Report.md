# Executive Summary
A Rates Rebate is a subsidy (currently up to $640) for low-income homeowners on the cost of their residential rates. The subsidy is delivered by Local Councils and is administered by Central Government (currently the Department of Internal Affairs (DIA)). The entitlement value is calculated by the cost of the rates, applicants income, and number of dependants. The maximum subsidy amount is reviewed yearly.

Following a successful (and [award winning](https://nzosa.org.nz/finalists2018/)) [Alpha](https://www.digital.govt.nz/blog/making-it-easier-the-rates-rebates-story-so-far/) phase in May and September 2018, the Rates Rebate beta trial was run in June and July 2019 by a team with members from Service Delivery and Operations team within DIA, Government Information Services, and the Service Innovation Lab. 

Three councils (Tauranga City Council, Hutt City Council, and Kāpiti Coast District Council) were invited to participate from a larger group that expressed interest. These councils each run a different IT system for processing applications, providing a good test of any proposed process changes, and a good indication of the challenges of rolling out the solution more widely.

Evidence gathered during the beta trial supported the observation during the Alpha phase that an optimised online application form takes just 4 minutes to complete on average, compared to 25 minutes for the paper form. Feedback from councils supported evidence gathered via observation that the online application was considered much easier for applicants to complete. 

The beta dramatically reduced per transaction costs for councils, completely eliminating the need to courier paper applications between councils and the DIA. Councils have communicated their intention to actively promote the online option (if it proceeds beyond beta) based on the improved experience for applicants (and lower processing costs).

The statutory declaration remains the single biggest barrier preventing large scale adoption of an online application process (as well as a significant barrier to those applying on paper). Removing the statutory declaration removes the requirement to visit a council to submit an application. A paper was written to support the case for this change during the beta phase. If the case for change is supported, this requirement could be removed by June 2020.

Together with the Rates Rebate Beta Research Report, this report documents the key results of the trial, presents options for next steps, and makes a set of recommendations.
