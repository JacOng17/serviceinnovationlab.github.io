Becoming an adult is a key time when people begin to interact with government in new ways as they make significant decisions about their lives. During this period young adults are not only defining who they are and what they care about, but they may also be entering tertiary study or further training, becoming a parent, getting a job, leaving home, moving to another region or going overseas.

Becoming an adult in New Zealand looks very different for each person and can be influenced by many variables. The ‘becoming an adult’ project was undertaken by a cross-branch DIA team to look into improving how young adults access government services and prove who they are (manage their identity).

### Project objectives

- Understand the current state of identity management for 16-20 year olds and the role digital identity currently has in their lives.
- Test assumptions around the experience, use of and value of digital identity for accessing government services.
- Identify opportunities and future trends that could support this cohort in accessing services.

### Our approach

The project was the first chance for the whole design team at the Service Innovation lab  to work together to not only achieve the brief faster but consolidate our approach on how we run research discoveries.

Part of this was to test our new measurement framework to better understand what good work looks like at a project level. For more detail read [What Does ‘Good’ Look Like? Innovation in Public Service Design](https://www.digital.govt.nz/blog/what-does-good-look-like/).

The project team comprises a product owner, 4 service designers and a scrum master, and the work was undertaken over 12 weeks.
With a limited timeframe to complete the research the team used the following approach:

- Semi-structured interviews 1.5 hours long with tailored activities around control and independence, identity and online behaviour.
- Desk research on emerging trends, literature review and analysis, and testing of existing services.
- Connected with identity experts and projects across government.
