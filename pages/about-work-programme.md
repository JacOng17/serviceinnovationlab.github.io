## Work Programme

Our work programme included initiatives that usually fell outside the remit, capability or budget of a single agency.

*The Lab contributed to the Services Innovation Work Programme*

All the initiatives we worked on were service delivery focused. They either helped people interact with government directly or indirectly by improving the behind the scenes processes and infrastructure to enable a better experience for those who deliver them and receive them. This indirect work was part of our goal of opening up government services and data so it can be reused safely by other parts of local, central government, private sector and NGO service providers. We call this Government as a Platform.

__At its core, it’s about ensuring people’s government experiences are easy, equitable and empathetic - whether directly or through their own trusted channel or service provider.__
